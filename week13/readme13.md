Sorting and Searching Algorithms Project
Overview
This project contains multiple C++ programs demonstrating fundamental sorting and searching algorithms. It includes examples and exercises to understand the concepts better and practice their implementation.

Included Examples and Exercises
Example 13.1
Description: Demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm by sorting an array of integers. It shows how adjacent elements are repeatedly swapped to arrange the array in ascending order.

Exercise 13.1
Description: Implements Selection Sort to sort an array. The program finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the beginning element.

Exercise 13.2
Description: Implements Insertion Sort, which builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

Exercise 13.3
Description: Implements Heap Sort, a more efficient sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.

Example 14.1
Description: Demonstrates Searching Algorithms, including Sequential Search and Binary Search. It shows how to find an element in an array, with binary search applied only on sorted arrays for faster performance.

Features
Clear demonstration of sorting techniques with step-by-step array modifications.

Comparison of different sorting algorithms based on their working principles.

Searching techniques applied on sorted and unsorted arrays.

Performance insights through counting swaps, comparisons, and timing (where applicable).

How to Use
Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).

Run the executable and follow the prompts to input data or test predefined arrays.

Observe the sorted outputs and search results displayed in the console.

Purpose
This collection is designed for beginners to practice and understand sorting and searching algorithms through example-based learning and hands-on exercises.

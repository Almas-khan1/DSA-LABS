This project contains two C++ programs demonstrating doubly linked lists.

Example 7.1: Shows how to create a doubly linked list of integers with these features:

Add elements to the back (pushBack) and front (pushFront)

Remove elements from the back (popBack) and front (popFront)

Check if the list is empty (isEmpty)

The example adds some numbers, then pops and prints all from the back.

Exercise 7.1: Similar doubly linked list but for very large numbers (long long type).

Supports adding at front and back, and removing from front.

Inserts big numbers and then prints them by popping from the front.

Both programs teach how to manage nodes with prev and next pointers for two-way navigation and dynamic memory use.

To run, compile and follow the codeâ€™s output.

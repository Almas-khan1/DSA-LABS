This project contains simple linked list programs in C++ to practice basic operations like adding, removing, and showing items.

Tasks 6.1 & 6.2: Use a template class CustomList to create a linked list that works with any data type. It supports:

Adding elements at the front (push)

Removing the first element (pop)

Inserting a new element after a specific value (insertAfter)

Deleting a specific value (deleteItem)

Task 6.3: Uses a fixed LinkedStructure class with integer values and lets you:

Create a list by entering numbers

Display the list

Remove the first or last item

Remove a specific value from the list

The programs show how linked lists work with pointers, dynamic memory, and simple linked list operations.

To run, just compile the code and follow the input instructions (for task 6.3).

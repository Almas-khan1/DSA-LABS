This collection includes C++ programs demonstrating standard template library (STL) usage and basic algorithms.

Example 12.1
Creates a vector of integers 0 to 24, shuffles it randomly, and prints the shuffled elements.

Example 12.2
Creates a list of integers 0 to 24, then prints and removes each element from the front until empty.

Example 12.3
Creates a deque of integers 0 to 24, shuffles it, then prints and removes elements from the front.

Example 12.4
Uses a stack built on a list container to push integers 1 to 9, then pops and prints them in LIFO order.

Example 12.5
Demonstrates bitset operations by inverting a 16-bit binary number and printing the result bit by bit.

Example 12.6
Searches for the number 37 in a vector of 100 integers and prints the index if found.

Example 12.7
Performs a set union on two integer arrays and prints the combined unique sorted elements.

Exercise 12.8
Shows how to fill arrays with a specific value using fill and fill_n functions.

Exercise 12.9
Calculates and prints the sum and product of elements in an integer array using accumulate.

Example 12.10
Defines a custom String class, shuffles and sorts a vector of these strings, then prints before and after sorting.

Exercise 12.11
Reads words from input and counts their frequency using a map, then prints each word with its count.

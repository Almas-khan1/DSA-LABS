A recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

Example 3.2 - String Reversal

A recursive function to reverse a string input by the user.

Example 3.3 - Power Function

A recursive function to compute x^n using recursion.

Example 3.4 - Ackermann Function

Implementation of the Ackermann function, which is a recursive function used in theoretical computer science.

Exercise 3.1 - Power Function (Extended)

This exercise extends the power function to compute powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20.

Exercise 3.2 - Ackermann Function (Different Inputs)

A different test case for the Ackermann function with inputs m=3, n=4.

Exercise 3.3 - Various Recursive Problems

(A) Printing Numbers in Reverse Order

A recursive function that prints numbers from n down to 0.

(B) Binomial Coefficient Calculation

A recursive function to compute the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which is used in combinatorial mathematics.

(C) Prime Number Check

A recursive function to check if a number is prime.

How to Run

Compile the C++ files using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for Linux/Mac or Visual Studio for Windows).

Run the compiled executable and enter the required input values.

Observe the recursive function execution and output.

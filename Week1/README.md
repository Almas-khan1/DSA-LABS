This repository contains multiple C++ examples demonstrating template programming, class templates, file handling, and sequence manipulation. Each example highlights key C++ concepts such as templates, class structures, and file I/O operations.

Examples Included:

Template Function for Maximum Value - Demonstrates the use of function templates to find the maximum of two values.

Class Template (mypair) - Implements a class template that finds the maximum and minimum of two values.

Template Class for Sequences - A class template for handling sequences, including setting and retrieving values, and computing min/max values.

File Handling Basics - Example programs that read from and write to text files.

Student Data Processing - Reads student grades from a file, calculates averages, and displays class performance statistics.

Compilation & Execution:

To compile any of the examples, use a C++ compiler such as g++:

g++ example.cpp -o example
./example

Replace example.cpp with the filename you want to compile.

Requirements:

C++ Compiler (g++, MSVC, Clang, etc.)

Basic understanding of C++ syntax and concepts
